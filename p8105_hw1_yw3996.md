# Problem 1

Load the moderndive library:

``` r
library("moderndive")
```

load the early_january_weather dataset:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Here’s a short description of the dataset:

-   the variables in this dataset includes origin (EWR), year (2013),
    month (Jan), day (ranges from 1 to 15), hour, temp, dewp, humid,
    wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and the
    time_hour. <span style="color: red;">**needs to be
    clarified**</span>
-   The dataset contains 358 records on the weather in early January and
    15 variables.
-   The mean temperature is 39.58.

Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using the
humid variable (by adding color = … inside of aes in the ggplot code).

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Here’s a description of the plot:

As time went by, the temperature had an increase tendency, the humidity
also increased during Jan, 2013.

Export the scatterplot to the project directory using ggsave.

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1p1_scatterplot.pdf")
```
